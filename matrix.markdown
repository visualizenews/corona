    This matrix shows how the different Italian regions reached a specific set of milestones during the course od the epidemic. By selecting one of the indicators, you will be able to see how the pandemic spread at different speeds in different areas of the country. The marker indicates the first day on which the event has occurred in each region.

    For mobile users, the regions are shown as aggregated into macro-regions: "Northern Italy" includes Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Lombardy, Liguria, the Autonomous Provinces of Bolzano and Trento, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, and Emilia Romagna. "Central Italy" includes Tuscany, Lazio, Umbria, and Marche. "Southern Italy" includes Campania, Calabria, Puglia, Molise, Abruzzo, Basilicata, Sicily, and Sardinia. In this case, the marker indicates the day on which the event has occurred for the very first time within the macro-region.
  explanation: 'We grouped the milestones in six different clusters: total cases,
    new cases, active cases, fatalities, hospitalised, and admitted in ICU. Each one
    of them has a unique corresponding symbol. The color of the symbol represents
    the the number of people affected, with a progression that starts from 100 to
    go to 100,000.'
