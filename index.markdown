introduction: "Italy has been the first European country to be seriously affected
  by the Corona Virus outbreak: the reported cases went from 2 to hundreds in less
  than a week, while other European countries seemed initially immune to the infection.
  The virus is now spreading all across the planet and on 12th March the WHO announced
  the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.  \nIn this page we are exploring how the pandemic
  is affecting Italy and how it fares in comparison to other countries and regions
  to help understand how this is evolving.  \nWe use data gathered from [Johns Hopkins
  University](https://systems.jhu.edu/ \"JHU CSSE\"), the [KCDC](https://www.cdc.go.kr/
  \"KCDC\"), and the [Italian Civil Protection](http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/
  \"Protezione Civile Nazionale\")\n\n[Scroll down](#page \"Scroll down\") to learn

  title: A timeline of Covid-19 in Italy
  introduction: This **timeline** of the evolution of the epidemic in Italy goes back
    to **24th February** - the first day the Italian Civil Protection started sharing
    official data about the **COVID-19** outbreak - and it is updated daily.

  explanation: Each column represents an indicator. The bars represent the cumulative
    value by day (with the _New Cases_ column showing daily value). The width of each
    bar shows the number of people affected. Hover on the bars to see the details
    for each day.

  title: 'It all started on 31st January '
  text_block: "On 31st January, the Italian media reported the first cases of Covid-19
    in Italy: **a Chinese couple from Wuhan** who fell ill while in Rome.\n\nThey
    were quickly hospitalised and isolated, and the Italian health authorities started
    tracing their path back to understand who they had been in contact with. The result
    was appalling. During the previous week, **the couple had visited some of Italy's
    major tourist destinations**: Milan, Verona, Parma, Florence, and of course  Rome.\n\nOn
    the same day, **Italy cancelled all direct flights to and from China** and declared
    a state of emergency. From this day on, things started to accelerate dramatically.
    \ \nOn 21st February, an unassociated cluster of 16 cases was confirmed in **Lombardy**,
    in northern Italy.  \nOn 22nd February, the Council of Ministers announced a new
    decree-law to contain the outbreak, including **quarantining over 50,000 people**
    from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.\n\nOn 4th March, the Italian
    government **closed all schools and universities** nationwide as Italy reached
    100 deaths and put all sport and public events on hold for at least one month.
    \ \nOn 11th March, Prime Minster Conte ordered **the closure of most commercial
    activities** except for those selling basic commodities such as pharmacies and
    supermarkets.\n\nBy 17th March, Italy had already become **the second worst affected
    country** by COVID-19, right after China."

  explanation: 'In this chart, the figure for each day is calculated as the average
    number of  new cases registered on that specific day and in the previous six days.
    We noticed a few patterns in the data: on Sundays and Mondays, for instance, the
    number of new cases is usually lower than in the other days of the week, and it
    tends to increase again on Tuesdays. By relying on the moving average calculation
    method, we managed to make these trends more visible.'
  title: Has Italy crossed the peak?
  introduction: 'The following chart shows how the number of new cases is evolving
    over time in Italy and in every Italian region. Each point corresponds to the
    weekly moving average (i.e. the average value of the current day and the previous
    and following 3 days): this statistical calculation method, often used in technical
    analysis of financial data, helps smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight
    longer-term trends.'

  title: Progress of the epidemic in each Italian region
  introduction: 'Italy''s national health service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) is
    organised under the Ministry of Health and administered on a regional basis: each
    one of the nineteen regions (and the two autonomous provinces of Trento and South-Tirol
    that form the "Trentino Alto-Adige/Südtirol" region) has its own organisation
    and rules. Epidemic control is coordinated by the government through the Ministry
    of Health, the ISS (Istituto Superiore di Sanità), and the Civil Protection, yet
    that does not prevent regions from setting local rules in order to improve the
    effectiveness of the efforts. For instance, Lombardy is now funding and building
    a new COVID-19 hospital with a capability of over 400 beds, more than half of
    them in ICU, on the premises the old Milan Fairground.'
  explanation: This charts show the number of confirmed cases since the day when at
    least one confirmed case was reported in the region.

  title: How does the relation between the number of active cases and recovered people
    change over time?
  explanation: In this chart we show the number of daily active cases as a bar. The
    distance between the bar and the x-axis represents the number of people that did
    officially recover. Our hope is to see the coloured bar shrink and eventually
    disappear as it gets further from the bottom.
  placeholder_id: cases-recovered
  object: casesRecovered
  introduction: The following charts show the daily correlation between the number
    of active cases and the number of people who recovered. It clearly appears how
    a few north Italian regions (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto) are the epicenters
    of the infection in Italy. To better frame the impact of the epidemic on the economy,
    consider that Lombardy alone contributes to more than 22% of the Italian GDP.

  image: "/uploads/ 2020/03/07/map.png"
  text_block: After going silent for one month, the virus had such a devastating outbreak
    that the Italian government quarantined two huge areas in Lombardy. The so-called
    **Red Zones** have been locked out from the rest of the country so that nobody
    could enter or leave them. Barely two weeks after the outbreak, the Italian government
    realised that its efforts had not worked as expected and had to be strengthened.

  centered_title: false
  introduction: The comparison between the amount of daily new confirmed cases and
    the recoveries shows the strain on the National Healthcare System. A balanced
    proportion between recoveries and new cases represents a scenario in which the
    system is coping sufficiently with the Covid-19 crisis. The following chart shows
    how after the peak of daily new cases around the end of March, the two indicators
    are converging towards each other. The hope is to see the number of recoveries
    to cross the daily cases followed by a trend towards zero of both the lines.
  explanation: The chart shows the weekly moving average of new daily cases and daily
    recoveries. This statistical calculation method, often used in technical analysis
    of financial data, helps smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term
    trends.

  introduction: |-
    The amounts of current hospitalizations and recoveries are some of the most reliable indicators we can use. They represents tangible numbers provided by the hospitals to the Italian Civil Protection and they help to understand how the national healthcare system is coping with the epidemic.

    After reaching its peak on April 4, the total number of people hospitalized with symptoms and in ICU has started to decrease, while the recoveries are showing a steady increase.

    Following the peak, the number of hospitalizations has been plateauing and, finally, since April 11 the number of people who have recovered has crossed the ones still hospitalized.

  title: And then everything fell apart
  text_block: |-
    On Saturday, 7th March, **the whole region of Lombardy** and fourteen more provinces were locked down. Because Lombardy alone contributes to more than 22% of the Italian GDP, this measure also basically meant **locking down the world's 8th biggest economy**.

    On 9th March, the Italian government decided to **lock down the entire nation** in a desperate attempt to slow down the spreading of the disease.

  title: How many people have been tested?
  introduction: It would appear that Italy has enforced a policy of testing as many
    people as possible, especially in the areas that were mostly affected by the virus.
    Yet is that accurate?

  explanation: The white area represents 100.000 people, the purple square(s) represent

    Korea. Cyan square(s) is visible only when the data is available.

  introduction: 'The following charts show how is the relation between number of tests
    performed, number of people actually tested, and Region''s population. We created
    this index called _Repeated tests ratio_ that is nothing more than total number
    of total tests divided by total number of people tested. You''ll notice how different
    Regions pursued different policies regarding testing: some regions tested the
    same person more than once (ratio >= 2), others tested every person just once
    (ratio = 1). The differences between the Regions might also be explained by the
    number of confirmed cases: in a Region with few confirmed cases tests have an
    high probability to come out negative, thus a second test when the symptoms end
    is not required.'
  explanation: The outer ring represents the Region's population. The size is the
    same for all the Regions if you choose to see "Normalized" data. The Light-pink
    circle represents the number of tests performed, while the darker-pink circle
    represent the number of people that have been tested. The size of the circles
    represents either the absolute number or the normalized number, based on the option
    selected.

  title: But China was already fighting the virus, and South Korea was about to follow
  image: ''
  text_block: |-
    Official statements by the Chinese government to the World Health Organisation reported that the first confirmed case had been diagnosed on **8th December**. However, according to a paper later published by _South China Morning Post_, the first case can be traced back to 17th November.

    Whether the early mid-November cases were undetected, unrecognised, or simply unreported, **China had already been dealing with COVID-19 for two months** when the emergency spread to the rest of the world.

    The first confirmed case in South Korea was announced on 20th January. As of today, China's and South Korea's case histories are **the world's major benchmarks** in terms of epidemiological data, timeline and solutions. Experts are relying on the Chinese and South Korean cases to make forecasts and predictions about the emerging cases, including Italy.

    We compared the confirmed cases of the three major Covid-19 epicenters in the world:

    * Hubei province (population 58,500,000): the area where the COVID-19 outbreak started, presumably in November 2019;
    * Daegu (population 2,489,802): the epicenter of the Korean contagion which started from the Shincheonji Church of Jesus sect, where the disease spread among members, in December 2019;
    * Lombardy (population 10,078,012): the epicenter of the Italian contagion, which had a major outbreak in February 2020.

  introduction: |-
    This matrix shows how the different Italian regions reached a specific set of milestones during the course od the epidemic. By selecting one of the indicators, you will be able to see how the pandemic spread at different speeds in different areas of the country. The marker indicates the first day on which the event has occurred in each region.

    For mobile users, the regions are shown as aggregated into macro-regions: "Northern Italy" includes Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Lombardy, Liguria, the Autonomous Provinces of Bolzano and Trento, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, and Emilia Romagna. "Central Italy" includes Tuscany, Lazio, Umbria, and Marche. "Southern Italy" includes Campania, Calabria, Puglia, Molise, Abruzzo, Basilicata, Sicily, and Sardinia. In this case, the marker indicates the day on which the event has occurred for the very first time within the macro-region.
  explanation: 'We grouped the milestones in six different clusters: total cases,
    new cases, active cases, fatalities, hospitalised, and admitted in ICU. Each one
    of them has a unique corresponding symbol. The color of the symbol represents
    the the number of people affected, with a progression that starts from 100 to
    go to 100,000.'

  introduction: 'Is there a relation between the performed tests and the people found
    positive to **COVID-19**? In this chart we try to highlight the relation between
    the two values, trying to answer a question that Italians ask themselves very
    often recently: is Italy''s Coronavirus death rate really higher than in the rest
    of the world or, simply, there is more people positive in our country?'
  explanation: The x-axis is the time. Violet points represent the number of tests
    performed every day. Purple points represent news cases discovered. the distance
    between the two points represent tests with a negative result ("no-sick"). The
    distance (and the change of the distance over time) highlights the change in percentage
    and might help understand if it's true that a lot of positive cases aren't discovered.
