introduction: |-
  Italy has been the first European country to be seriously affected by the Corona Virus outbreak: the reported cases went from 2 to hundreds in less than a week, while other European countries seemed immune to the infection. We use data gathered from the [WHO](https://www.who.int "World Health Organization") and from the [Italian Civil Protection](http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/ "Protezione Civile Nazionale") to try to compare Italy with other European and non-European countries to better visualise what happened.

  title: Everything began on January 30th
  text_block: |-
    On January 30th, Italian media reported the first cases of Covid-19 in Italy: two Chinese tourists who felt sick while in their hotel room in Rome.

    They had been quickly moved to an isolation area, and the Italian Health authorities started following their path back, to understand who they've been in contact with. It resulted the two tourists visited almost every major city in Italy in the previous two weeks: Milan and Florence, but also shopping malls, and outlets.

    After one month during which the virus went silent, the outbreak has been so devastating the the Italian government declared two "red zones", locked-out areas that no one could enter or leave. Both of the areas are in northern Italy, and both are still isolated from the rest of the nation.

    Red zoned-areas include the towns of Codogno, Senna Lodigiana, Casal Pusterlengo XXXXX in Lombardy, and Vo' Euganeo and XXXXX in the region of Veneto.

    by a CORDONE of officers from the Italian Police, Carabinieri and Army. Basic
    services are provided the Italian Civil Protection. These services include food,
    medical assistance, and PPPPPP

  title: And then, everything fell apart
  text_block: |-
    After just two weeks after the outbreak, the Italian government realised that the response to the virus wasn't enough, and on Saturday March 7th decided to lock down the entire Lombardy Region, and four-teen other provinces.

    Just to give you an idea of the size of the decision: Lombardy alone contributes with more than 22% to the GDP.
