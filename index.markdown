introduction: |-
  Italy has been the first European country to be seriously affected by the Corona Virus outbreak: the reported cases went from 2 to hundreds in less than a week, while other European countries seemed immune to the infection. We use data gathered from [Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/ "JHU CSSE") and the [Italian Civil Protection](http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/ "Protezione Civile Nazionale") to try and compare Italy with other European and non-European countries in order to better understand what is happening.

  title: It All Began on January 31
  text_block: |-
    On January 31, the Italian media reported the first cases of Covid-19 in Italy: **a Chinese couple from Wuhan** who got sick while in Rome.

    They were quickly hospitalized and isolated, and the Italian health authorities started tracing their path back to understand who they had been in contact with. The result was appalling. During the previous week, **the couple had visited some of Italy's major tourist destinations**: Milan, Verona, Parma, Florence, and of course  Rome.

    On the same day, **Italy cancelled all flights to and from China** and declared a state of emergency. From this day on, things started to accelerate dramatically.

    On February 21, an unassociated cluster of 16 cases was confirmed in **Lombardy**, in northern Italy.

    On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including **quarantining over 50,000 people** from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.

    On March 4, the Italian government **closed all schools and universities** nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths and put all sporting and recreative events on hold for at least one month.

    On March 11, Prime Minster Conte ordered **the closure of most commercial activities** except for those selling basic commodities such as pharmacies and supermarkets.

    By March 17, Italy had already become t**he second worst affected country** by COVID-19, right after China.

    Official statements by the Chinese government to the World Health Organisation reported that the first confirmed case had been diagnosed on December 8. However, the first case can be traced back to November 17 (source: South China Morning Post)

    After one month during which the virus went silent, the outbreak has been so devastating the the Italian government declared two "red zones", locked-out areas that no one could enter or leave. Both of the areas are in northern Italy, and both are still isolated from the rest of the nation.

    Red zoned-areas include the towns of Codogno, Senna Lodigiana, Casal Pusterlengo XXXXX in Lombardy, and Vo' Euganeo and XXXXX in the region of Veneto.

    by a CORDONE of officers from the Italian Police, Carabinieri and Army. Basic
    services are provided the Italian Civil Protection. These services include food,
    medical assistance, and PPPPPP

  title: And then, everything fell apart
  text_block: |-
    After just two weeks after the outbreak, the Italian government realised that the response to the virus wasn't enough, and on Saturday March 7th decided to lock down the entire Lombardy Region, and four-teen other provinces.

    Just to give you an idea of the size of the decision: Lombardy alone contributes with more than 22% to the GDP.

    Two days after locking down the vast majority of northern Italy, on March 9th, the Italian government decided to lock-down the entire nation, in a desperate effort to stop the spreading of the disease.

    Italians are forbidden to travel abroad as well as within the country. Schools, theatres, cinemas, and gyms are closed, all sport events (including the Series A) have been suspended. Health services are being re-organized, in order to get as many beds as possible in ICUs.

    People are asked to stay home and limit social interactions. TVs and radios continuously broadcast the list of things everyone should do to help:

    * Wash hands
    * Be careful when you cough or sneeze, do it in a tissue and dispose it immediately
    * Don't stay closer than 1 meter to other people
    * Avoid crowded places
    * If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home and contact the emergency number: don't go to your doctor, don't go the the ER

    change over time?
  explanation: In this chart, we shown the number of daily active cases as a bar.
    The distance between the bar and the x-axis represents the number of people that
    did officially recover. Our hope is to see the coloured bar shrink and then disappear
    while it moves further from the bottom.
