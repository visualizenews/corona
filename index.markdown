introduction: |-
  Italy has been the first European country to be seriously affected by the Corona Virus outbreak: the reported cases went from 2 to hundreds in less than a week, while other European countries seemed immune to the infection. We use data gathered from the [WHO](https://www.who.int "World Health Organization") and from the [Italian Civil Protection](http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/ "Protezione Civile Nazionale") to try to compare Italy with other European and non-European countries to better visualise what happened.

    On January 30th, Italian media reported the first cases of Covid-19 in Italy: two Chinese tourists who felt sick while in their hotel room in Rome.

    They had been quickly moved to an isolation area, and the Italian Health authorities started following their path back, to understand who they've been in contact with. It resulted the two tourists visited almost every major city in Italy in the previous two weeks: Milan and Florence, but also shopping malls, and outlets.
