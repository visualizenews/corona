page_keywords: corona virus,covid-19,italy,sars-cov-2
introduction: |-
  Italy has been the first European country to be seriously affected by the Corona Virus outbreak: the reported cases went from 2 to hundreds in less than a week, while other European countries seemed immune to the infection. We use data gathered from [Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/ "JHU CSSE"), the [KCDC](https://www.cdc.go.kr/ "KCDC"), and the [Italian Civil Protection](http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/ "Protezione Civile Nazionale") to try and compare Italy with other European and non-European countries in order to better understand what is happening.

  title: The timeline of Covid-19 in Italy
  introduction: Here is the **timeline** of the epidemic in Italy starting from **February
    24th**, the first day the Italian Civil Protection started sharing official data
    about the **COVID-19** outbreak.

  title: It All Began on January 31
  text_block: "On January 31, the Italian media reported the first cases of Covid-19
    in Italy: **a Chinese couple from Wuhan** who got sick while in Rome.\n\nThey
    were quickly hospitalized and isolated, and the Italian health authorities started
    tracing their path back to understand who they had been in contact with. The result
    was appalling. During the previous week, **the couple had visited some of Italy's
    major tourist destinations**: Milan, Verona, Parma, Florence, and of course  Rome.\n\nOn
    the same day, **Italy cancelled all flights to and from China** and declared a
    state of emergency. From this day on, things started to accelerate dramatically.
    \ \nOn February 21, an unassociated cluster of 16 cases was confirmed in **Lombardy**,
    in northern Italy.  \nOn February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new
    decree-law to contain the outbreak, including **quarantining over 50,000 people**
    from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.  \nOn March 4, the Italian
    government **closed all schools and universities** nationwide as Italy reached
    100 deaths and put all sporting and recreative events on hold for at least one
    month.  \nOn March 11, Prime Minster Conte ordered **the closure of most commercial
    activities** except for those selling basic commodities such as pharmacies and
    supermarkets.\n\nBy March 17, Italy had already become **the second worst affected
    country** by COVID-19, right after China."

  title: Progress of the epidemic in each Italian region
  introduction: 'Healthcare in Italy is coordinated in a centralised way, but managed
    at a regional level: each one of the nine-teen (and the two autonomous provinces
    of Trentino and South-Tirol that form the "Trentino Alto-Adige/Südtirol" region)
    has its own organisation and rules.Epidemic control is anyway coordinated by the
    government through the Ministry of Health, the ISS (Istituto Superiore di Sanità),
    and the Civil Protection, but that doesn''t prevent regions to set local rules
    in order to improve the effectiveness of the efforts. One example? Lombardy is
    now building with its own funds a new COVID-19 hospital, capable of more than
    400 ICU beds, in the old Milan''s Fair area.'

  title: How does the relation between the number of active cases and recovered people
    change over time?
  explanation: In this chart, we shown the number of daily active cases as a bar.
    The distance between the bar and the x-axis represents the number of people that
    did officially recover. Our hope is to see the coloured bar shrink and then disappear
    while it moves further from the bottom.
  placeholder_id: cases-recovered
  object: casesRecovered
  introduction: The following charts show the daily correlation between the number
    active cases and the number of recovered people. It is clear how few north-italian
    regions (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto) are the epicenters of the infection
    in Italy. To better frame the impact of the epidemic on the economy, consider
    that Lombardy alone contributes to more that 20% of Italian GDP.

  text_block: After going silent for one month, the virus had such a devastating outbreak
    that the Italian government quarantined two huge areas in Lombardy. The so-called
    **Red Zones** have been locked-out from the rest of the country so that nobody
    could enter or leave them. Both of these areas are located in northern Italy,
    and both are still partially isolated because the Government later imposed country-wide
    country restrictions, **turning Italy into one Red Zone**.

  title: And then everything fell apart
  text_block: |-
    Barely two weeks after the outbreak, the Italian government realised that its efforts had not worked ad expected and had to be strengthened.

    On Saturday, March 7th, **the whole region of Lombardy** and fourteen more provinces were locked-down.

    Because Lombardy alone contributes to more than 22% of the Italian GDP, this measure also basically meant **locking down the world's 8th biggest economy**.

    On March 9, the Italian government decided to **lock-down the entire nation** in a desperate attempt to slow down the spreading of the disease.

  title: How many people have been tested?
  introduction: It would appear that Italy has enforced a policy of testing as many
    people as possible, especially in the areas that were mostly affected by the virus.
    Yet is that accurate?

  object: tested
  explanation: The white area represents 100.000 people, the purple square(s) represent
    the people tested in Italy, the cyan square(s) represent the people tested in
    Korea. Cyan square(s) is visible only when the data is available.

  title: But China was already fighting the virus, and South Korea was about to follow
  introduction: |-
    Official statements by the Chinese government to the World Health Organisation reported that the first confirmed case had been diagnosed on **December 8**. However, according to a paper later published by _South China Morning Post_, the first case can be traced back to November 17.

    Whether the early mid-November cases were undetected, unrecognized, or simply unreported, **China had already been dealing with COVID-19 for two months** when the emergency spread to the rest of the world.

    The first confirmed case in South Korea was announced on January 20. As of today, China's and South Korea's case histories are **the world's major benchmarks** in terms of epidemiological data, timeline and solutions. Experts are relying on the Chinese and South Korean cases to make forecasts and predictions about the emerging cases, including Italy.

    We compared the incidence rate (per 100k people) of the three major Covid-19 epicenters in the world:

    * Hubei province (population 58,500,000): the area where the COVID-19 outbreak started, presumably in November 2019;
    * Daegu (population 2,489,802): the epicenter of the Korean contagion which started from the Shincheonji Church of Jesus sect, where the disease spread among members, in December 2019;
    * Lombardy (population 10,078,012): the epicenter of the Italian contagion, which had a major outbreak in February 2020.

    Each epicenter tackled the contagion with different strategies.
  placeholder_id: comparisonChart
  explanation: "We decided to show the incidence rate as a means to compare the strain
    each region is under. Why? Because we believe that, from a reader'a standpoint,
    it could be easier to grasp relative numbers rather than huge, absolute figures.
    \ \nOf course, we are aware that the virus spreads at an unvarying pace, regardless
    of a country's size."
