introduction: |-
  Italy has been the first European country to be seriously affected by the Corona Virus outbreak: the reported cases went from 2 to hundreds in less than a week, while other European countries seemed immune to the infection. We use data gathered from [Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/ "JHU CSSE") and the [Italian Civil Protection](http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/ "Protezione Civile Nazionale") to try and compare Italy with other European and non-European countries in order to better understand what is happening.

  title: It All Began on January 31
  text_block: |-
    On January 31, the Italian media reported the first cases of Covid-19 in Italy: **a Chinese couple from Wuhan** who got sick while in Rome.

    They were quickly hospitalized and isolated, and the Italian health authorities started tracing their path back to understand who they had been in contact with. The result was appalling. During the previous week, **the couple had visited some of Italy's major tourist destinations**: Milan, Verona, Parma, Florence, and of course  Rome.

    On the same day, **Italy cancelled all flights to and from China** and declared a state of emergency. From this day on, things started to accelerate dramatically.

    On February 21, an unassociated cluster of 16 cases was confirmed in **Lombardy**, in northern Italy.

    On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including **quarantining over 50,000 people** from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.

    On March 4, the Italian government **closed all schools and universities** nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths and put all sporting and recreative events on hold for at least one month.

    On March 11, Prime Minster Conte ordered **the closure of most commercial activities** except for those selling basic commodities such as pharmacies and supermarkets.

    By March 17, Italy had already become t**he second worst affected country** by COVID-19, right after China.

    After going silent for one month, the virus had such a devastating outbreak that the Italian government quarantined two huge areas in Lombardy. The so-called **Red Zones** have been locked-out from the rest of the country so that nobody could enter or leave them. Both of these areas are located in northern Italy, and both are still partially isolated because the Government later imposed country-wide country restrictions, **turning Italy into one Red Zone**.

    The original Red Zones include the towns of Codogno, Castiglione d'Adda, Casalpusterlengo, Fombio, Maleo, Somaglia, Bertonico, Terranova dei Passerini, Castelgerundo and San Fiorano in Lombardy, and the municipality of Vo' Euganeo in the Veneto region.

  title: And then everything fell apart
  text_block: |-
    Barely two weeks after the outbreak, the Italian government realised that its efforts had not worked ad expected and had to be strengthened.

    On Saturday, March 7th, **the whole region of Lombardy** and fourteen more provinces were locked-down.

    Because Lombardy alone contributes to more than 22% of the Italian GDP, this measure also basically meant **locking down the world's 8th biggest economy**.

    On March 9, the Italian government decided to **lock-down the entire nation** in a desperate attempt to slow down the spreading of the disease.

  text_block: "Official statements by the Chinese government to the World Health Organisation
    reported that the first confirmed case had been diagnosed on **December 8**. However,
    according to a paper later published by _South China Morning Post_, the first
    case can be traced back to November 17.\n\nWhether the early mid-November cases
    were undetected, unrecognized, or simply unreported, **China had already been
    dealing with COVID-19 for two months** when the emergency spread to the rest of
    the world. \n\nAs of today, China's case history is **the world's major benchmark**
    in terms of epidemiological data and timeline, and the main one experts are relying
    on to make forecasts and predictions."

  title: How many people have been tested?
  introduction: It would appear that Italy has enforced a policy of testing as many
    people as possible, especially in the areas that were mostly affected by the virus.
    Yet is that accurate?

  explanation: The white area represents 100.000 people, the purple square(s) represent
    the people tested in Italy, the cyan square(s) represent the people tested in
    Korea. Cyan square(s) is visible only when the data is available.

    by a CORDONE of officers from the Italian Police, Carabinieri and Army. Basic
    services are provided the Italian Civil Protection. These services include food,

    Italians are forbidden to travel abroad as well as within the country. Schools, theatres, cinemas, and gyms are closed, all sport events (including the Series A) have been suspended. Health services are being re-organized, in order to get as many beds as possible in ICUs.

    People are asked to stay home and limit social interactions. TVs and radios continuously broadcast the list of things everyone should do to help:

    * Wash hands
    * Be careful when you cough or sneeze, do it in a tissue and dispose it immediately
    * Don't stay closer than 1 meter to other people
    * Avoid crowded places
    * If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home and contact the emergency number: don't go to your doctor, don't go the the ER

    change over time?
  explanation: In this chart, we shown the number of daily active cases as a bar.
    The distance between the bar and the x-axis represents the number of people that
    did officially recover. Our hope is to see the coloured bar shrink and then disappear
    while it moves further from the bottom.
