introduction: "Italy has been the first European country to be seriously affected
  by the Corona Virus outbreak: the reported cases went from 2 to hundreds in less
  than a week, while other European countries seemed initially immune to the infection.
  The virus is now spreading all across the planet and on 12th March the WHO announced
  the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.  \nIn this page we are exploring how the pandemic
  is affecting Italy and how it fares in comparison to other countries and regions
  to help understand how this is evolving.  \nWe use data gathered from [Johns Hopkins
  University](https://systems.jhu.edu/ \"JHU CSSE\"), the [KCDC](https://www.cdc.go.kr/
  \"KCDC\"), and the [Italian Civil Protection](http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/
  \"Protezione Civile Nazionale\")\n\n[Scroll down](#page \"Scroll down\") to learn

  title: A timeline of Covid-19 in Italy
  introduction: This **timeline** of the evolution of the epidemic in Italy goes back
    to **24th February** - the first day the Italian Civil Protection started sharing
    official data about the **COVID-19** outbreak - and it is updated daily.

    bar shows the number of people affected. Hover on the bars to see the details

  title: 'It all started on 31st January '
  text_block: "On 31st January, the Italian media reported the first cases of Covid-19
    in Italy: **a Chinese couple from Wuhan** who fell ill while in Rome.\n\nThey
    were quickly hospitalised and isolated, and the Italian health authorities started
    tracing their path back to understand who they had been in contact with. The result
    was appalling. During the previous week, **the couple had visited some of Italy's
    major tourist destinations**: Milan, Verona, Parma, Florence, and of course  Rome.\n\nOn
    the same day, **Italy cancelled all direct flights to and from China** and declared
    a state of emergency. From this day on, things started to accelerate dramatically.
    \ \nOn 21st February, an unassociated cluster of 16 cases was confirmed in **Lombardy**,
    in northern Italy.  \nOn 22nd February, the Council of Ministers announced a new
    decree-law to contain the outbreak, including **quarantining over 50,000 people**
    from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.\n\nOn 4th March, the Italian
    government **closed all schools and universities** nationwide as Italy reached
    100 deaths and put all sport and public events on hold for at least one month.
    \ \nOn 11th March, Prime Minster Conte ordered **the closure of most commercial
    activities** except for those selling basic commodities such as pharmacies and
    supermarkets.\n\nBy 17th March, Italy had already become **the second worst affected
    country** by COVID-19, right after China."

  title: Progress of the epidemic in each Italian region
  introduction: 'Italy''s national health service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) is
    organised under the Ministry of Health and administered on a regional basis: each
    one of the nineteen regions (and the two autonomous provinces of Trento and South-Tirol
    that form the "Trentino Alto-Adige/Südtirol" region) has its own organisation
    and rules. Epidemic control is coordinated by the government through the Ministry
    of Health, the ISS (Istituto Superiore di Sanità), and the Civil Protection, yet
    that does not prevent regions from setting local rules in order to improve the
    effectiveness of the efforts. For instance, Lombardy is now funding and building
    a new COVID-19 hospital with a capability of over 400 ICU beds on the premises
    the old Milan Fairground.'
  explanation: This charts show the number of confirmed cases since the day when at
    least one confirmed case was reported in the region.

  title: How does the relation between the number of active cases and recovered people
    change over time?
  explanation: In this chart we show the number of daily active cases as a bar. The
    distance between the bar and the x-axis represents the number of people that did
    officially recover. Our hope is to see the coloured bar shrink and eventually
    disappear as it gets further from the bottom.
  placeholder_id: cases-recovered
  object: casesRecovered
  introduction: The following charts show the daily correlation between the number
    of active cases and the number of people who recovered. It clearly appears how
    a few north Italian regions (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto) are the epicenters
    of the infection in Italy. To better frame the impact of the epidemic on the economy,
    consider that Lombardy alone contributes to more than 22% of the Italian GDP.

    After going silent for one month, the virus had such a devastating outbreak that the Italian government quarantined two huge areas in Lombardy. The so-called **Red Zones** have been locked out from the rest of the country so that nobody could enter or leave them. Barely two weeks after the outbreak, the Italian government realised that its efforts had not worked as expected and had to be strengthened.

    On Saturday, **7th** **March**, **the whole region of Lombardy** and fourteen more provinces were locked down. Because Lombardy alone contributes to more than 22% of the Italian GDP, this measure also basically meant **locking down the world's 8th biggest economy**. On **9th March**, the Italian government decided to **lock-down the entire nation** in a desperate attempt to slow down the spreading of the disease.

    people as possible, especially in the areas that were mostly affected by the virus.
    Yet is that accurate?

  title: But China was already fighting the virus, and South Korea was about to follow
  image: ''
  text_block: |-
    Official statements by the Chinese government to the World Health Organisation reported that the first confirmed case had been diagnosed on **8th December**. However, according to a paper later published by _South China Morning Post_, the first case can be traced back to 17th November.

    Whether the early mid-November cases were undetected, unrecognised, or simply unreported, **China had already been dealing with COVID-19 for two months** when the emergency spread to the rest of the world.

    The first confirmed case in South Korea was announced on 20th January. As of today, China's and South Korea's case histories are **the world's major benchmarks** in terms of epidemiological data, timeline and solutions. Experts are relying on the Chinese and South Korean cases to make forecasts and predictions about the emerging cases, including Italy.

    We compared the confirmed cases of the three major Covid-19 epicenters in the world:

    * Hubei province (population 58,500,000): the area where the COVID-19 outbreak started, presumably in November 2019;
    * Daegu (population 2,489,802): the epicenter of the Korean contagion which started from the Shincheonji Church of Jesus sect, where the disease spread among members, in December 2019;
    * Lombardy (population 10,078,012): the epicenter of the Italian contagion, which had a major outbreak in February 2020.
